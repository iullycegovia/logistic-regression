# Measuring the Relationship Between Life Satisfaction and Diet using SOEP Data
Relationship between diet and life satisfaction using logistic regression 

# Overview
This GitHub repository contains the code and analysis for measuring the relationship between life satisfaction and diet using the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) data. The SOEP dataset is a valuable resource for studying various aspects of individual well-being, socio-economic factors and lifestyle choices.

In this analysis, we aim to explore whether there is a significant correlation between an individual's dietary habits and their reported life satisfaction scores. We will use statistical techniques to uncover potential insights into how diet might impact overall life satisfaction.

# Data Source
